## Part 1
In 5 to 10 years, I want to be working on research that will positively impact the lives of individuals living with a disease or disability. Being able to apply everything I've learned during my years of schooling to make a positive difference is truly what I hope to be known and recognized for.
     My motivation comes from my uncle, who is a paraplegic and uses a wheelchair. I have seen how small discoveries can make a significant difference in his life, and I aspire to create similar impacts for others.
